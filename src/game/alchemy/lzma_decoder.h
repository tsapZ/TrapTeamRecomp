// A plain LZMA (LZMA1) decoder for the compressed blocks of the game's .arc / .bld archives: each
// block is 5 property bytes followed by a raw LZMA stream without end marker, and its unpacked
// size is known from the archive. Written from the format as described in the public-domain LZMA
// SDK (DOC/lzma-specification.txt); one block is at most 32 KB. Taken from GiantsRecomp, which
// has it from SwapForceRecomp (src/game/alchemy/lzma_decoder.h there).
