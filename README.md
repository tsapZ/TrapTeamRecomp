# TrapTeamRecomp

An unofficial native Windows port of **Skylanders: Trap Team** (2014, Xbox 360), made with
static recompilation (ReXGlue). Work in progress: Chapter 1 plays with a figure on the emulated portal.

> **Unofficial fan project.** Not affiliated with or endorsed by Activision or Toys for Bob. This
> repository contains **no game data**: you need your own copy of the game.

## Why this exists

I wanted to play the Xbox 360 Skylanders games on my PC with just a controller, no emulator, and
with a nicer picture. That's really all it is: a private fan project. It's public in case someone
else wants the same.

## How it was made

To be upfront about it: almost all of the code here was written by [Claude](https://claude.ai) in
Claude Code, the recompile setup, the fixes, the portal menu, the launcher and the installer, and
most of the docs too. I decided what to build, said what was broken and played the games a lot. If
AI-made projects aren't your thing, that's fair.

It runs on its own; [Core of Light](https://github.com/tsapZ/SkylandersCoreOfLight) is the launcher
for all six ports if you want them in one place.

## Play it

You need:

- Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit) and a graphics card with DirectX 12
- **your own copy of the game**: the Xbox 360 disc listed under [Which disc](#which-disc), as an ISO
  or an extracted folder (nothing of the game comes with this project)
- a controller (Xbox or compatible; keyboard and mouse work too). A real Portal of Power is
  optional: the emulated portal's menu has every figure

Then:

1. Download from the [Releases](https://github.com/tsapZ/TrapTeamRecomp/releases) page: just this game's
   installer, or [Core of Light](https://github.com/tsapZ/SkylandersCoreOfLight/releases), the
   launcher that downloads and sets up all six games.
2. Start it and choose your ISO. It checks that it is the right disc and sets the game up.
3. Play. When the game asks for a Skylander, the portal menu opens by itself: pick one.

## Status

| Portal menu | ✅ opens by itself at the prompt, with the game's collection cards and fonts, hats and upgrade trees |
| Settings | ✅ native 3D picture, the game's FXAA at the internal resolution, bloom and motion blur strength, the controller picture |

Where each part stands and what comes next: [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md); session details and
known bugs: [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md). Part of six ports of the Xbox 360 Skylanders games,
started together from [Skylanders: Core of Light](https://github.com/tsapZ/SkylandersCoreOfLight).

## What it adds

- **Native Windows program**: the game's Xbox 360 code recompiled to x86-64 (no emulator of the
  CPU), the GPU through Xenia's D3D12 path.
- **Picture**: internal resolution 1x, 2x or 3x of the console's 720p, sharpened with AMD CAS,
  16x texture filtering, presets *Performance*, *Quality* (2x, recommended) and *Best*. The game's
  own 3D picture at its native size instead of the console's smaller one is an experimental
  option.
- **60 FPS** (what the installer sets); 30 as on the console, or 144, 200 and more.
- **Ultrawide**: a wider window shows more to the sides, with the HUD at the window's edges.
- **The Portal of Power** emulated (figures as `.dump` files), a real USB portal, or both at once.
  The **portal menu** (Guide, Back + Start or F6) is drawn in the game's own fonts with its own
  pictures of every figure, their hats and upgrade trees, per player, for controller and keyboard.
- **A settings menu** in the same style (F4 or Back + RB): graphics, frame rate, language, portal,
  controls with the game's controller picture.
- **Achievements**, shown in the portal menu and in the Core of Light launcher.
- English and German menus; French, Spanish and Italian are offered too.

## Which disc

The European Xbox 360 disc (PAL, title `41560911`). Its SHA-256 is pinned in
[docs/game/default.xex.sha256](docs/game/default.xex.sha256): the game, the installer and the launcher
check it. Other regions have another `default.xex` and are refused at start.

## Installing

- **Installer (beta):** `just package-installer` builds `installer/Output/TrapTeamRecompSetup-<version>.exe`
  (Inno Setup; the same file is on the [Releases](https://github.com/tsapZ/TrapTeamRecomp/releases) page). It installs into your user folder
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Trap Team Recompiled`, no admin rights) and asks for your disc, as an ISO or an
  already extracted folder (it checks the version, then copies the files next to the game), the
  game language, the portal (emulated, real USB or none), the window size and the internal
  resolution. Everything else starts at the settings above (60 FPS, sharpening, 16x filtering) and is changed later in the F4 menu.
- **[Skylanders: Core of Light](https://github.com/tsapZ/SkylandersCoreOfLight)**, the launcher
  for all six ports, finds the installed game, sets up its disc from your ISO, keeps profiles with
  their own saves and figures and starts the game.
- **From source:** build it (below), put the extracted disc into `rom/` ([rom/README.md](rom/README.md))
  and run `just play-release`.

Your figures are `.dump` files in `Documents\Skylanders\Figures`, shared by every game, like real
figures next to the portal. The saves are in `Documents\trapteamrecomp`, the settings file next to the
game's exe.

## Reporting a problem

Open an [issue](https://github.com/tsapZ/TrapTeamRecomp/issues/new/choose) with the **Problem** form and say
what you did and what happened. The most useful thing to add is the report from Core of Light:
**LB** (the launcher's settings) > **Report a problem**, or the question that comes up by itself
after a crash. It writes one text file to the desktop with the latest logs and settings of every
game, with your Windows user name taken out; drag that file into the issue. Without the launcher,
each game keeps its logs in the `logs` folder next to its exe.

## Building

The same as the other Skylanders ports: see [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).
