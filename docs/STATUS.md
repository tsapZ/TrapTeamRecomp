# Status

Updated at the end of every session. Only record what a build actually did.

## Current state (2026-10-21)

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Repository | scaffolded from GiantsRecomp: build, app, portal (emulated, USB, hybrid), portal / player / settings menus, achievements, input scripts and test tools; none of its game hooks or file readers |
| Game data | disc extracted into `rom/` (2124 files), `default.xex` hash pinned |
| SDK | our fork `tsapZ/rexglue-sdk`, branch `skylanders`, shared with the other games |
| Codegen | runs; 14 function starts the analyzer put one instruction late are registered in `config/default.toml` before anything calls them |
| Boot | ✅ to the title screen on the first try: the copyright screen, the Activision and Toys for Bob logo movies, then "Drücke A zum Starten" (German by language "auto") |
| Menus | ✅ autosave notice, save slot, difficulty, "Spiel wählen" (Story); Start skips the opening movie |
| Logo movies | skipped (`skip_intro`, on): the title screen after about 15 s; the opening movie optional (`skip_opening_movie`, off) |
| In-game | ✅ Chapter 1 (Sprudelquell) loads, the pause menu opens, the cutscene plays |
| Portal | ✅ emulated: the game asks "Spieler 1: Setze einen Skylander auf das Traptanium-Portal", a Spyro's Adventure figure put on by script (Chop Chop) gets its intro and plays with the HUD. The portal menu doesn't open by itself yet (no prompt watch for this game) |

## 2026-10-21: session log

- **Own repository**, like the other games: each playable on its own, later through the hub
  (Skylanders: Core of Light).
- **Scaffold:** GiantsRecomp's tracked files, renamed; its Giants-specific parts left out.
- **Disc:** the same layout as Giants (`character\`, `item\`, `level\`, `misc\`, `movies\`, `outfit\`, `permanent\`, `.arc` / `.bld`), but the archives are IGA version 11 (Giants: 8), so Giants' readers for portraits, upgrades, hats and item names are left out until they read this version.
- **First codegen and boot:** no codegen fixes needed so far (Giants needed four Bink jump tables); the title screen comes up after the logo movies.
- **First level with a figure** (script, test copy): the menus behind the title, the opening movie (Start skips it), Chapter 1 and the portal prompt; Chop Chop put on the emulated portal comes in with his intro and plays. Next: the menu opening by itself at the prompt (the game's prompt object), the logo and opening movie skip, the game's pictures (IGA v11).
- **14 late function starts registered:** SuperChargers and Imaginators stopped at boot on functions the analyzer had started one instruction late; the same search in this game's code found 14, none reached yet. Registered; Chapter 1 with the figure checked again afterwards.
- **Logo movie skip** ported from GiantsRecomp: the midasm hook at 0x821A3DA0 right after BinkOpen reads the 44-byte header (here at r1+112), the movies recognised by their size and frame count (Activision 226, Toys for Bob 300 frames; the opening movie FMV1.mov 6941). Checked: both logos skipped, the title at 15 s.
