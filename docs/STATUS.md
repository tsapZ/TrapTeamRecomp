# Status

Updated at the end of every session. Only record what a build actually did.

## Current state (2026-10-21)

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Repository | scaffolded from GiantsRecomp: build, app, portal (emulated, USB, hybrid), portal / player / settings menus, achievements, input scripts and test tools; none of its game hooks or file readers |
| Game data | disc extracted into `rom/` (2124 files), `default.xex` hash pinned |
| SDK | our fork `tsapZ/rexglue-sdk`, branch `skylanders`, shared with the other games |
| Codegen | runs without any `config/default.toml` entry; the build links |
| Boot | ✅ to the title screen on the first try: the copyright screen, the Activision and Toys for Bob logo movies, then "Drücke A zum Starten" (German by language "auto") |

## 2026-10-21: session log

- **Own repository**, like the other games: each playable on its own, later through the hub
  (Skylanders: Core of Light).
- **Scaffold:** GiantsRecomp's tracked files, renamed; its Giants-specific parts left out.
- **Disc:** the same layout as Giants (`character\`, `item\`, `level\`, `misc\`, `movies\`, `outfit\`, `permanent\`, `.arc` / `.bld`), but the archives are IGA version 11 (Giants: 8), so Giants' readers for portraits, upgrades, hats and item names are left out until they read this version.
- **First codegen and boot:** no codegen fixes needed so far (Giants needed four Bink jump tables); the title screen comes up after the logo movies. Not tried yet: the menus behind the title, a level, the portal.
